# Code Review Guidelines (reference this later when doing peer review)

- Every [Issue](./issues.md) should be code reviewed by another OCAT internship-peer
  - Making a Pull Request
    - Create a Pull Request (PR) from your development branch (your current branch) into main (the main branch)
      - [Creating a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
    - Reach out to one of your fellow OCAT interns and ask them nicely to review your code. Include a link to the Pull Request you'd like them to review
    - Take any suggestions with a grain of salt. Remember, this is YOUR application. Make any changes you agree with and then merge the Pull Request
  - Reviewing a Pull Request (PR)
    - [Reviewing a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews)
    - Go the link supplied by whichever OCAT intern has requested a review from you
    - Look through their code, offering suggestions and critiques
      - You should try to:
      - Understand each part of the code and look for ways to improve it
      - Be kind. Remember that this is someone else's work that they've spent a lot of time on
      - Balance criticism with praise. It is tempting to only point out the negatives. If you see something you like, tell them!
      - Feel free to ask questions. In the end, this is a learning process. Feel free to ask questions if you don't understand something in the code.
  - After a Pull Request (PR) has been approved, merge it and move on
    - [Merging a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request)
    - Once merged, create a new branch from main and start on your next issue
